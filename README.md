#### My project connects to my [Bridge2AI](https://github.com/matheuskroska/Bridge2AI) API, which has endpoints for [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/). Upon submitting a prompt, the information is sorted and a structured page is created with images and text generated by AI. At the end, the user can generate a PDF for printing.

## The concept is to generate small stories accompanied by images in a cool format. The tool aims to explore the capacity of artificial intelligence and create interesting and fun applications that have real usefulness.
